## The Next Web Clone

This project is the collaboration of [Zlatan](https://github.com/zlayabekrija) & [Inzi](https://github.com/inhaq). [Preview this project](https://zlayabekrija.github.io/the-next-web-clone/)

To enhance and practice our HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, we tried to clone design of The Next Web site. 

In the process we learn about pair programming(collaboration), Version control system(Git & Github), responsive design, media queries, background images, gradient, positioning, floats.

### Pair Programming

We created another branch(development) and did all our commits on it. After completion we merged it to the master and put preview of this webpage on Github Pages.

### Responsive

This website is responsive across devices with different viewports.
